## Building the Site

```
make build
```

This watches the files in the project for changes and rebuilds when they change. You need to make sure you build before you commit.

## Running the Server

```
make
```

Make starts the server on port 8080.

## Stopping the Server

```
make stop
```

## Logs

```
make logs
```

## To Create Landing Pages

Create an HTML file in the root of the project.  I recommend copying an existing landing page. You can define the page's URL in the file using the permalink option.
