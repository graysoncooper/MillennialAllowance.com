                <h1>Week 1: Build Your First Website!</h1>
                <p>Right now, you more than likely have little to no programming experience, but that&#39;s okay.  The first step to becoming a software developer is learning how to program.</p>

<p>Since you are learning web development, you need to learn how to build web applications.  <strong>But what is a web application?</strong></p>

<p>A web application, or web app for short, is simply a website that interacts with the user to manage data.  You probably use web apps all the time and didn&#39;t even know it.  Facebook and Dropbox are great examples of common web apps.</p>

<p>You would more than likely get overwhelmed if you tried to learn everything about web apps at once.  So instead, I recommend starting with a small, but functional project and building on it from there.  With that in mind, let&#39;s get started on project 1!</p>

<h3>Project 1: Build and deploy a simple web app</h3>

<p>Since you more than likely don&#39;t have any programming experience, it&#39;s important to learn some fundamentals immediately.  For your first project, I suggest building a web app that only renders a few web pages. This should take around 10 to 15 hours so pace yourself.</p>

<p><a href="/tutorials/build-and-deploy-nodejs-app-to-heroku/intro">Click here to start project 1!</a></p>

<p>You&#39;ll learn a lot in this project, but you need to make sure to learn the following:</p>

<h4>How websites work</h4>

<p>Since you are learning web development, you need to understand the basics of the internet.  What this really means is understanding what happens when a browser makes a request to a website.  You need to understand the difference between client and server, what makes up a URL and what happens when a web browser requests a web page.</p>

<h4>Basics of building a web server</h4>

<p>Websites run on web servers. Web Server is a fancy name for a computer that is connected to the internet and serves web pages to the user&#39;s browser.  There are a lot of programming languages you can use to create web servers, but I recommend Javascript since it is relatively fast, easy-to-use and is used by a lot of big tech companies like Netflix, PayPal, and LinkedIn.</p>

<p>To write web servers with Javascript, you use Node.js.  Node.js is a program that runs Javascript code on a web server.  You&#39;ll hear a lot of people use Node.js and Javascript interchangeably when talking about web servers.</p>

<h4>How to deploy your app to the web</h4>

<p>When learning, I find it&#39;s really important to deploy projects to the internet. Seeing the final product will help you stay motivated because you see real results rather than blindly creating something you won&#39;t use.  To deploy your web app, I recommend using Heroku.</p>

<p>Heroku makes deploying a Node.js web app simple by providing already configured servers for your app.  All you have to do is send Heroku your code and tell them how to start your web app.  They do the rest!</p>

<h4>All of this in one tutorial</h4>

<p>Piecing together programming concepts as a beginner is difficult and time-consuming. I created a free tutorial that will walk you through all of the above concepts. The tutorial takes you from no programming experience to building and deploying your first web app from scratch.</p>

<p><a href="/tutorials/build-and-deploy-nodejs-app-to-heroku/intro">Click here to start project 1!</a></p>

<p>Because it&#39;s your first project, you will get frustrated at times.  If you run into trouble, don&#39;t get discouraged. Instead, take a break, come back later with a fresh perspective.</p>

<p class="info">
Remember, learning is about consistently working towards your goal.  You are inevitably going to run into issues. Don't get discouraged &mdash; it's part of learning.
</p>

<p>If you have any questions while taking the tutorial, feel free to leave a comment in project 1 or email me at <a href="mailto:shane@trysparkschool.com">shane@trysparkschool.com</a>.</p>

<p>Enjoy the tutorial and I&#39;ll see you next Monday!</p>

<p>Happy coding,<br>
Shane</p>
