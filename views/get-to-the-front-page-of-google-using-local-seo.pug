                h2 Frequently Asked Questions
                p.bold Why do I want to get on the front page of Google? 
                p Google attempts to offer the most relevant search results for users. The results are given by using the search terms and location data. If you're looking for a dentist, you're going to want to find one in your area. 
                p The more visible you are when users are searching for your product or service, the more likely it is that the user will find your business' online and become a paying customer. 
                p.bold What kind of results will I see?
                p Results will vary from business to business, but you should expect to see an obvious increase in new customers after getting to the front page of Google.
                p.bold How long does it take to see results?
                p Depending what your online presence is like currently, it could take up to 8 weeks to start seeing results; however, SEO results grow over time and is directly correlated to how much effort is put in. Whatever results you'll see at the 2-4 month range, will be noticeably less than what you're getting at the 4-8 month point!
                p.bold How much time will this take me?
                p Setting up your website for local SEO takes some upfront work, but after it's setup, you should see traffic begin to come organically from Google. If you continue to work on improving your SEO, you could expect to spend 10-hours a month and see the distinct effects!
