                    Customers that have purchased from your business **are more likely to buy from you again** since you delivered on their previous purchase.

                    Instead of hoping they come back, you should send them reminders and discounts to stay top of mind. Email is the perfect way to do this!

                    Perfectly timed email discounts and reminders **drive existing customers back to your business like crazy!**

                    The best part is you are providing value by reminding them you can solve the problem they have. Everyone wins!

                    To make it as easy as possible to get started, I am offering **5 email templates that you can use for your business.** All you have to do is fill in some information about your business and you are ready-to-go!

                    Enter your email below to get the templates other businesses are using to turn existing customers into repeat customers!

                p.bold Won't I be spamming my existing customers?

                p It's a common misconception that all emails are spam.  That's just not the case!

                p Sure, if your customer isn't interested in what you are sending, you are spamming them. But these 5 email templates are designed to provide value to your customer.

                p The more value you provide, the more likely your customer will fall in love with your business and make additional purchases.  Everyone wins!


                p.bold How long will it take to see results?

                p As soon as you send your first email!

                p With these templates, all you have to do is fill in a few blanks and you are ready to go. It's as easy as that!

                p.bold Is this something I can set up on my own?

                p
                    | Absolutely! The easiest way to send emails is with a&nbsp;
                    a(href='https://mailchimp.com/') MailChimp
                    |  account.

                p If you need help sending emails, sign up and send me an email. Simply say "I need help setting up MailChimp" and I'll help you get set up!

                p.bold Do I need an existing list of each customer's email address?

                p It would make things easier if you already had a list of email addresses, but it's not necessary. You will need to start collecting them, though.

                p If you need help collecting email addresses from your customers, sign up and send me a message. Just say something like, "I need help collecting emails" and we'll get it figured out :)
