<p>Whether your business is just starting or you want to take it to the next level, doubling your customers will have a huge impact on your business!</p>
<p><strong>It turns out that this is easier than you might expect too.</strong> Most small businesses aren't using the tools in this list and the ones that do see new paying customers every day.</p>
<p>Simply integrating these tools with your business will allow you to reach more people so you always have a steady stream of customers to your business.</p>
<p>I won't keep you waiting any longer. Here is the list of 7 tools you can use on your business to double your customers. Enjoy!</p>
<h2>The 7 Tools to Double Your Customers</h2>
<h3><strong>Sumo.com</strong></h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/fb-ads-series/day-2/yoga-studio-sumo-welcome-mat.png" alt=""></p>
<p>More often than not, when someone first visits your business's website, they probably aren't going to be ready to buy from you. That's like asking someone to marry you before you have had a first date.</p>
<p>Instead of going straight for the sale, it's better to ask for something like their email address in exchange for something small. This lets you keep in touch so they get to know you better.  Ultimately, they will be more likely to purchase from you.</p>
<p>Sumo.com makes collecting emails easy!  They provide a suite of tools to help you build forms to collect contact information from website visitors. Generally, these forms offer something like free information, a free quote or first-time discount to entice users to sign up.</p>
<p>If your offer is relevant to your business, the people opting in will be highly interested in something related to your business. That means the email addresses you collect will not only be <strong>more likely to purchase</strong>, but they will also <strong>buy more from you.</strong> That sounds pretty nice!</p>

<h3><strong>Mailchimp</strong></h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/fb-ads-series/day-2/final-thank-you-email.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Sumo.com helps you collect email addresses, but they won't send emails.  Instead, you will need a Mailchimp account. Mailchimp makes it easy to store lists of email addresses as well send emails to those people.</p>
<p>At the very least, you'll need to send a thank you email to new subscribers containing the offer they signed up for.</p>
<p><strong>The conversation doesn't stop there, though!</strong> Now that a future customer has given you their email address, they expect you to send them future messages.</p>
<p>This is your chance to build a relationship with them and show them how your business will solve their problem. Good things to send are education around your business, new product offerings, holiday sales, etc.</p>

<h3><strong>Facebook Ads Manager</strong></h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/fb-ads-series/day-3/final-yoga-ad-example.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Your offer will only collect emails if you have website visitors. Currently, you might be getting some website traffic from Google searches, but those are only people searching for your business.</p>
<p><strong>What about everyone that doesn't know about your business yet?</strong></p>
<p>Facebook Ads help you expand your reach and drive massive traffic to your website. With over a billion daily users, you can be sure your customers are on Facebook.  <strong>But how do you find them?</strong></p>
<p>With the Facebook Ads Manager you can segment groups of people by location, interests, job title, etc. Seriously, check it out.  It's crazy!</p>
<p>You can show ads to only people in your area that are highly interested in something related to your business. This means website visitors are going to be more likely to signup for your offer resulting in more people purchasing!</p>

<h3><strong>Hubspot Free Stock Images</strong></h3>
<p><img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Picjumbo-1.jpg?t=1489201537240&amp;width=1338&amp;name=Picjumbo-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This isn't really a tool, but it is an extremely useful resource for high-quality stock photos you can use for your Facebook Ads.</p>
<p>I recommend trying a few images from your business as well as a few stock photos to see what works best for your audience.</p>

<h3><strong>Gimp</strong></h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/tools-to-double-your-customers/editing-an-image-in-gimp.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This is a free version of Photoshop that you can use to edit images.  Most of the time, you won't need to do more than add some text or a colored overlay to an image. Gimp will help you get it done!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gimp.org/">Here's a link to Gimp's website.</a></p>
<h3><strong>Zapier</strong></h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/tools-to-double-your-customers/using-zapier-to-add-leads-to-google-sheet.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you're a small business that needs to talk to their customer 1 on 1 to make a sale or set up an appointment. Instead of sending automated emails, you might need to reach out personally.</p>
<p>It's not uncommon for businesses to manage these communications with a simple spreadsheet. But wouldn't it be nice if each person that signed up got added to that spreadsheet automatically?</p>
<p>With Zapier, you can set up automations like the one I just described. They make it easy to connect hundreds of services, so you can automate tasks and free up some of your time!</p>

<h3><strong>Google Drive</strong></h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/tools-to-double-your-customers/leads-crm-in-a-google-sheet.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I'm sure it goes without saying that every business needs spreadsheets and documents for things like budgets, memos, etc.</p>
<p>Google Drive provides a free spreadsheet and document editor as well as cloud storage for your files. Since everything is stored in the cloud you can easily share your documents and have them wherever you go.</p>
<p>I recommend using Google Drive for your documents if you want to set up automations with Zapier.</p>
