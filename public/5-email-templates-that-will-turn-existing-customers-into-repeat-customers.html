<p><strong>Keep reading</strong> to learn more how you can turn existing customers into repeat customers.</p>

Enter your email and I'll send them to you for free.</p><div class="_form_9"></div><script src="https://sparkschool.activehosted.com/f/embed.php?id=9" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script></div></div></div></div><div class="section small"><div class="small-container"><div class="full"><h2>Why Email Marketing?</h2>
<p>It turns out email marketing is one of the most effective and easiest marketing channels.  Check out this chart from MarketingCharts.com:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/articles/marketing-charts-email-marketing-effectiveness-vs-difficulty.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As you can see, it's not only the most effective marketing channel, but it's also the easiest to use.</p>
<p>Whether you are already doing some email marketing or aren't sending email at all, these 5 emails will maximize your business's profits.</p>
</div></div></div><div class="section small"><div class="small-container"><div class="full"><h2>Email 1: Welcome Email</h2>
<p>Congratulations!  A customer has purchased from you, but at this point, they barely know you.  Welcome emails are a great way for you to tell customers more about your business.</p>
<p>Your welcome email should be sent within a day or two of the customer purchasing from your business.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be anything super long either.  Simply give them a friendly welcome and let them know who your business is, what your business stands for, and how your business will help them.  <strong>Make sure to keep it short and friendly!</strong></p>
<p>As well as introducing yourself, this is also a good place to set expectations about what emails they will receive in the future as well as how frequently they receive them.  You don't want to surprise customers by sending more email than they expect.  That's a one way trip to the spam folder!</p>
</div></div></div><div class="section small"><div class="small-container"><div class="full"><h2>Email 2: Reminders</h2>
<p>A lot of businesses have some kind of recurring service or purchase.  If you sell something you know your customer is going to need at a specific time in the future, send them a friendly email reminding them they are going to need your product or service soon.</p>
<p>These emails will convert to purchases like crazy! You are not only helping your customer by reminding them to do something, but also providing them a solution to their problem.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dentist offices could send a reminder to schedule a checkup every 6 months.</li>
<li>Power washing companies can send a reminder email for a fresh clean.</li>
<li>Car dealerships can remind their customers it's time for an oil change.</li>
<li>Jewelers can remind their customers that it is a good idea to clean their jewelry with you.</li>
</ul>
</div></div></div><div class="section small"><div class="small-container"><div class="full"><h2>Email 3: Discount on Specific Products or Services</h2>
<p>Ideally, you know what each person in your email list purchased.  If you do, you can offer similar products or service that you think they might be interested in.  The key is being specific!</p>
<p>If you can offer discounts on relevant items they are interested in, your customer is going to be stoked!</p>
<p>The best part is this doesn't even need to be a discount!  You can simply let them know you offer an additional service or product. A discount is just more enticing so you will see better results.</p>
<p>The key with this kind of email is to be friendly, and offer your product or service as additional value.</p>
<p>Think about this scenario. A customer just bought a subscription to your Yoga studio.  If you know their experience level, you can offer them relevant products.  For instance, a newbie probably needs a Yoga mat but will have no idea which ones are the best.</p>
<p>Guess what?  You happen to be an expert on Yoga mats and in fact, your business sells some of the best!  Let them know why they are the best and you can bet your customer is going to thank you not only verbally but with their wallet.  Cha-ching!</p>
</div></div></div><div class="section small"><div class="small-container"><div class="full"><h2>Email 4: Run Flash Sales</h2>
<p>Flash sales are simply sales you run for a short amount of time.  Some common examples are holiday sales, liquidation discounts, etc.</p>
<p>Just like any emails you send, these need to be used in moderation.  You can send flash sale emails about once a month without overdoing it.</p>
<p>This is a great way to boost sales for a month or drive customers to your business.  Usually, these emails have a  short time limit to promote instant action.</p>
</div></div></div><div class="section small"><div class="small-container"><div class="full"><h2>Email 5: Informational Email</h2>
<p>Informational email is any email that provides value to your customer without asking for a direct sale.  Your goal with this email isn't to make a sale.  Those emails can be sent later.</p>
<p>Informational emails are used to build trust with your user and nurture them into purchasing. Here are some ideas for things you could send:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How to use your product or service</strong> - if your product or service is complicated, this is a perfect way for you to offer instruction for free.  Send an email or two about how your customer can get the most from their purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Industry news</strong> - send recent news around your industry that customers are interested in.</li>
<li><strong>Educational content</strong> - there is almost always something you can teach your customers.  You're an expert after all!  Send that information for free as long as it's relevant and interesting to them.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement emails</strong> - ask customers specifically how you can help them more.  This is a great way to start a conversation, get new product ideas, and make sure your customers are satisfied with your business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though these emails don't drive sales directly, they will build trust with your customers which ultimately increases each customer's likeliness to purchase.</p>
<p>These emails also keep you out of the spam folder since you are providing value to your customer at no cost to them.</p>
