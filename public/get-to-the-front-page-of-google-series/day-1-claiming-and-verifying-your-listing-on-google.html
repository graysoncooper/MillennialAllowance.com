Then, you should see the value and the return on investment for your time.</p><p> Today's lesson should take you no more than two hours of work, but more realistically <b>significantly less time.</b></p><p> My goal with each lesson is to leave you with actionable advice about how to take your business to the front page of Google. If you have any questions don't hesitate to email me!</p><p class="info">This guide assumes you already have a website.  If you don't, email me at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:me@shaneburkhart.com.">Me@ShaneBurkhart.com</a> and I will help you set one up.</p><h2>Why is it important to be on the Front Page?</h2><p>4 in 5 people use Google search to find local product information. In 2014, Google partnered with two media firms to research and better understand consumer's local search behavior. Of the local searches, most included people searching for a specific type of local store, getting directions to a local store, trying to find hours of operation for a local store, looking for product availability at a local store. </p><p> These customers who are using google, are looking to make a purchase very soon. And, they're actually searching for the service you provide! They are in the perfect 
In fact, of those local searches, <b>18% of them lead to a purchase within a day. </b></p><p>Maybe you have a website, but you aren't listed on the front page. What does that mean for you? </p><p> <b>If you are not on the front page of google, only 10% of people searching will click to go to the next page of google.</b></p><p>So, let's say you own an ice cream store in Austin, Texas. By using Google's Keyword Planner tool, I found and calculated the average monthly searches for "ice cream Austin" and related searches. </p><center> <img src="/assets/images/front-page-series/google_keyword_planner_searches_ice_cream_austin.png" alt="Google Keyword Planner search result for Ice ccream Austin."></center><p>Adding them all up, there are at minimum 3,400 monthly searches for some variation of ice cream in Austin, Texas. And at maximum, 34,000! </p><p>If your local Austin business is on the front page of google when people search for "ice cream in Austin" you could be potentially getting all of those customers to see your business and decide to come in and enjoy your ice cream.</p><p>If 18% of those people searching came in and purchased a $4.00 ice cream, that will be in the range of $2,448 to $24,480 more sales a month for just a few hours of work! </p><p>If your business is not on the front page of Google, you are missing out on a huge opportunity to bring in new customers. </p><p class="info"> If you'd like for me to prepare a similar document to see how many people are locally searching for your service, email me at <a href="mailto:me@shaneburkhart.com">Me@ShaneBurkhart.com </a>with your business name and location! </p><h2>The First Steps to Getting on the Front Page of Google </h2><p>For the rest of day one, we are going to start with the most important part of getting to the front page of Google: Making sure your business is on Google Business and making sure all information is correct and claimed by you. </p><p>You may have noticed when you search for a product, it offers you a list of businesses and their location on Google Maps. Continuing with the ice cream example, we can see that when you search "ice cream Austin" it lists ice cream stores in Austin. </p><center><img src="/assets/images/front-page-series/googe_search_ice_cream_austin.png" alt="Google Search for Ice Cream Austin"></center><p>It's imperative that your business appears on this list for your service. That way, when people search for your product they can find your business. </p><p>There are many factors that go into appearing on this list and ranking in the first few businesses; however, the most common reasons why someone is at the top is: 1. The Google Business listing is claimed and verified, 2. The listing profile is 100% filled out and the information is consistent with your website, 3. Quality photos of your location, and 4. Reviews. We will cover points 1 and 2 today and focus on photos and reviews tomorrow.</p><p> <b>1: Claiming your Business Listing</b></p><p> It's likely that your business is already listed, but to make sure go to <a href="https://google.com">Google.com</a>and search for your business. Once you hit search, you should see your business listing on the right side of the page with your name, your business type, a description, your address, hours, phone number, a link to your website, and maybe some photos. </p><p> If you see the "Own This Business?" link, that is <b>not </b>good. Google sorts businesses that have claimed their listings first, so it's very important for you to click that link and follow the instructions to claim that listing. </p><p>Let's compare two local Austin places to get Ice Cream: Jim Jim's Water Ice and Prohibition Creamery.</p><center><img src="/assets/images/front-page-series/jim_jims_water_ice_google_search.png" alt="Google Business for Jim Jim's Water Ice listing"></center><p>As you can see, the owner of this Jim Jim's Water Ice has not claimed the business and it has the "Own This Business?" link. Because of this, it is listed on the second page of Google's Business suggestions when you search for ice cream in Austin. </p><center><img src="/assets/images/front-page-series/prohibition_creamery_google_search.png" alt="Google Business for Prohibition Creamery"></center><p>Comparing Jim Jim's to Prohibition Creamery, the only noticeable difference between the two Google Business listings is that Prohibition Creamery has been claimed. They have a similar number of reviews and with similar scores. </p><p> <b>2: Verifying, Updating, and Adding Information</b></p><p>Once you have claimed your listing (or created), you'll need to choose the category for what your business. This is the most important thing you do for your business because it helps Google decipher when to show your business when people search, just like a librarian can't find a book for you that is in the wrong section. So, absolutely make sure your primary category is the most descriptive one for your business. You will then be able to choose nine more categories as well. </p><p>As you fill this information out, you'll be asked to verify your business. Google will simply send you a letter in the mail with a code that you'll be asked to type in to verify you're the owner of the business. Once you do this, you'll gain access to responding to reviews which will come in handy later.</p><p>Next, it is important to be very consistent with all your business information. You should update and verify that your business name, description address, phone number, website URL, menu (if applicable), and hours are all correct. Your business data needs to be the same as it is on your website, facebook page, and any other directories it may be on. </p><p>If you happen to see multiple listings for your business on Google, you need to claim both listings so that you can edit and delete the duplicate data. Google has been known to punish or not show businesses that have inconsistent data even simple things like an apostrophe can make a big difference in where google places your business on their listings. </p><p>To optimize your business listing to entice searchers to decide to come to your business, you'll need to make sure that you have a description. Your description needs to contain words related to the services you provide and really tells visitors exactly what you do. </p><p>Take the example of Prohibition Creamery's description: "Cool spot for boozy and alcohol-free ice cream, plus milkshakes, wine & beer in rustic-chic digs." It lists all the goods they sell and really makes the place sound inviting, at least it does to me. </p><p> The last step for today is to <b>make sure your profile is as 100% complete! </b>Google prefers to show business listings that are completely filled out versus ones that are not. </p><p> Today I just wanted to give you an overview of why it's important to be on the front page of Google and give you some actionable suggestions that you could implement for your business today. Tomorrow, we'll dive into the details on photos for your Google Business listing and how to get reviews so that you can get yourself to the front page of Google!
